;; Preview latex equations in org mode in a separate buffer while
;; editing.  Possible configurations:
;;
;; To set the fraction of the window taken up by the previewing buffer
;; (setq org-elp-split-fraction 0.2)
;;
;; To adjust buffer name
;; (setq org-elp-buffer-name "*Equation Live*")
;;
;; To adjust idle time to run latex preview
;; (setq org-elp-idle-time 0.5)
;;
;; Launch or deactivate the previewing with
;; M-x org-elp-mode
;;
