  Short for: Org Equation Live Preview. It allows previewing the latex
  fragment while typing. How it works is that it will generate a split
  window and update the preview while typing.

* Installation
  =org-elp= is now on melpa. Install simply by =M-x package-install org-elp=.

* Usage
  To set the fraction of the window taken up by the previewing buffer
  #+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-elp-split-fraction 0.2)
  #+end_src
  To adjust buffer name
  #+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-elp-buffer-name "*Equation Live*")
  #+end_src
  To adjust idle time to run latex preview
  #+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-elp-idle-time 0.5)
  #+end_src
  These configurations can also be found in =M-x customize-group org-elp=.

  To Launch previewing, use =M-x org-elp-mode=, running the same command
  again will deactivate it.

* Screenshots
  Preview equations in org mode while editing. (Note that I used =M-x
  org-elp= in the screenshot. It has been changed to =M-x org-elp-mode=
  in the latest version.)
